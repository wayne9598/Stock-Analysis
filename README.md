# Basic Stock Analysis

* Basic data handling with the Pandas module and data visualisation with Matplotlib (Plot stock with candlestick and trading volumes)
* Import financial (stock) data into Python using the Pandas framework
* Pull in stock pricing data for a large number of companies, combine that data into one large dataset, and visually represent the relationship between companies (SP500)
* Create featuresets and labels from the DataFrame, feed through a machine learning algorithm map relationships of existing price changes to future price changes for a company
* Manipulate the data apply some machine learning to come up with a system for investing in companies, and back-test a strategy 

It allows you to create different sizes of array and adjust the animation speed and enjoy the show!
